PixelServer
===========

Implementation of a HTTP component which just serves a 1x1 transparent pixel menat to assist with tracking user movements on websites.
It cookies the users and logs the visit also accepts various parameters which can be sent by the website implementing the pixels.

This project started based on the [series of posts on my blog regarding online privacy](http://liviutudor.com/2014/09/11/tracking-users-online-part-1/). Its intent is to showcase what is happening behind the courtains when dealing with tracking users online.
[My blog](http://liviutudor.com) will contain a new blog post for each release of this project. For each such release I will be going through the changes operated and explain why they are necessary and what impact they have on the overall solution and why they were needed.
